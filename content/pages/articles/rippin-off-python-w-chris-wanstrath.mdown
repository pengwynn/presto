A great talk from [Chris Wanstrath](http://github.com/defunkt) ([@defunkt](http://twitter.com/defunkt)) on [Python](http://www.python.org/) from a [Rubyist's](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) perspective.

We too favor awesome docs for the projects that we feature, peps seem like an awesome concept to support (seriously), and hacking side-by-side with two languages is a nice way to get started with a new language...

Great work Chris on your journey through the various languages you've been able to have fun with. We appreciate you sharing what you've learned along the way.

Also, check out [Episode 0.1.0](http://bit.ly/tcl-0-1-1) w/ Chris.

#  SoundManager2: Cross-Browser/Platform Javascript Sound API

SoundManager 2 makes it easier to play sounds using Javascript. By wrapping and extending the Flash sound API, SoundManager 2 brings solid cross-browser/platform audio functionality to Javascript.

As seen on [Muxtape](http://muxtape.com/), [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/) / [The Cloud Player](http://www.thecloudplayer.com/) and [8tracks](http://8tracks.com/)

Some of the Basic API Features (Flash 8)

* Load, stop, play, pause, mute, seek, pan and volume control of sounds from Javascript
* Events: onload, whileloading, whileplaying, onfinish and more
* ID3V1 and ID3V2 tag support for MP3s (title, artist, genre etc.)
